- getenv(path) and call command if they in the path: 
  DONE

- background command: 
  DONE

- pipes
  DONE

- stdout/in redirection
  - stdout
    - create file if not exist,
    - overwrite it if exists (I guess)
  - stdin
    - abort if file does not exists,
    - read it if exists
  DONE

- built-in functions:
  - cd
  - exit

- Ctrl-C:
  - terminate the running command in lsh, but does not exit.

Optional objectives:
  - implement setenv and unsetenv.
  - implement wildcards
  - job control
  - implement basic shell language functions, such as loops for instance.



Bugs:
  -- At forground pipeline, lsh should wait until all the processes in the
  pipeline terminate.
